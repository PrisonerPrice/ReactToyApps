	$ cd my-app
	$ npm start

## Apps Category

### first-app

Use React's creat-react-app command to create a demo app.

### tic-tac-toe

Follow React's official tutorial to build this tic-tac-toe chess. Reference: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

### guess-numbers

A simple guessing number game. Reference: https://github.com/BradleyCulley/guess-the-number

### lunch-calculator

As we could not go out because of the coronavirus, we use UberEats everyday, so I wrote this little calculator to calculate everyone's spending on lunch.
